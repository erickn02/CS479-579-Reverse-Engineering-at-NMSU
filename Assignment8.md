# OSINT Investigation

On this OSINT investigation we want to start of things by using wikipedia, its a good place to start but we are going to back up everything we find with different sources. 
Wikipedia says that " njRAT, also known as Bladabindi, is a remote access tool (RAT) with user interface or trojan which allows the holder of the program to control the end-user's computer. It was first found in June 2013 with some variants traced to November 2012."
