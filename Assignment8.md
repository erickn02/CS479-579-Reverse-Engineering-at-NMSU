# OSINT Investigation

### Wikipedia
For this OSINT investigation, we want to start things by using Wikipedia, it's a good place to start but we are going to back up everything we find with different sources. 
Wikipedia says that " njRAT, also known as Bladabindi, is a remote access tool (RAT) with user interface or trojan which allows the holder of the program to control the end-user's computer. It was first found in June 2013 with some variants traced to November 2012."

### Cyborg Security
While Wikipedia gave us a good understanding of this RAT, Cyborg Security gives us more details and maybe more accurate dates for this remote access trojan. The site does say that this RAT has been observed since 2013 and that it might have been developed since 2010, one other thing this site mentions is some of the RAT's capabilities, and the text appears just as shown below...

> "The RAT features a number of features which are characteristic of other Remote Administration Tools, including keylogging, remote control of the system, access to the command line of the compromised system, access to the victim’s camera, and file, process, and registry management. The RAT is also capable of exfiltrating credentials from browsers. Another unique characteristic of the RAT is that the authors, and other actors, have created extensive documents and tutorials to teach prospective users how to use njRAT."

### CheckPoint
On this site, we get more details as to how this RAT spreads and what are possible ways to be the unlucky user that gets infected with this.
> NJRat has the ability to spread itself in a few different ways. While its primary infection vectors are phishing attacks and drive-by downloads, it also has the ability to spread itself via infected USB drives. The choice of propagation method can be set using the malware’s command and control (C2) software.
Once installed on a target system, the malware is designed to allow the attacker to remotely access and control that system.
