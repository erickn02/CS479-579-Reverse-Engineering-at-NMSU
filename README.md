# CS479-579-Reverse-Engineering-at-NMSU

Welcome to this repository dedicated to gathering reports on the reverse engineering of malware samples, based on the content of the book "Practical Malware Analysis." Within this collection, you will find various reports from malware analysis as the semester of spring 2024 progresses in the Class of Reverse Engineering at NMSU.

My goal for this report is for them to serve as a landscape of what has been done not only in the class but also as the learning curve in this field of study.
