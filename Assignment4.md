> For the first crack me I conducted a simple assembly language analysis, we did this example in class but I still found another way to find the answer, when I imported the crack me into Ghidra I started to make a quick analysis of the both the assembly and programmed code. While conducting this I realized that in the assembly code there was a string of the password needed to crack this crack me, then I proceeded to hardcode it into the KeyGen and succesfully complete this CrackMe.
