###  Type of Malware
It was discovered during the virus's dissection that the Windows operating system is its primary target.

Though it is similar to viruses in that it encrypts data and demands money, it also shows certain characteristics of a worm, which we are using to determine that this is a worm that also inhibits ransomware that seeks to scam cryptocurrency.

It also seems like a loader virus, which suggests that it can install and run libraries—a feature shared by many ransomware variants. Moreover, there are hints that this malware may have more than one function, possibly even a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).

This would make it easier for it to have access to the system for encryption purposes and might even give it control. These features also imply the existence of keylogging features that allow for the recording of private keystrokes.

###  Signatures
In the field of reverse engineering, comparing the hash value of the malware under analysis with its analysis is an often-used approach for detection. 

By using this method, analysts can save time by determining whether the virus has already been tested and reverse-engineered. 

We speed up the process by utilizing hash values, which may reveal modifications made by the malware to improve its evasive strategies.

###  Indicators of Compromise

Concerning this ransomware variant, it's expected that upon infection, a file will be generated, likely in the form of a ZIP archive containing the data held hostage from the victim's system. This operation typically involves the malware altering a registry key to grant itself unrestricted access to the files, thereby facilitating its malicious activities.

Regarding the ransom process, it's conceivable that the malware may or may not establish communication with the scammer. If communication is established, it would necessitate an active internet connection. However, in this instance, it's more probable for the ransomware to adopt a passive stance, awaiting the victim's initiative to contact the scammer and initiate the process of file retrieval. 

Consequently, there's no requirement for port openings, VPN connections, or wire guard setups. While such measures aren't essential, they may serve to augment the capabilities of the malware creator and enhance the effectiveness of the scam.

###  Clues about Origin

Is it similar to other malware from a specific threat actor?
Does it have filenames or strings that are similar to other malware?
Where was it found?
What is the C2 (command and control) infrastructure
